Python dictionaries can't be directly turned into JSON in a few situations:
	Unsupported Data Types:  
		Python dictionaries can hold various data types as values. 
		However, the json module has limitations on what it can serialize into JSON format. 
		Here are some examples:
			Custom Classes: 
				If your dictionary values include custom classes 
				without a built-in JSON representation, 
				json.dumps will raise an error.
			Functions: 
				Functions can't be directly stored in JSON.
	
	Cyclic References: 
		If your dictionary has circular references 
		(where objects refer to each other), 
		json.dumps will encounter an infinite loop and raise an exception.

	Non-String Keys:  
		JSON requires all keys to be strings. 
		While Python dictionaries can have keys of any hashable data type (like numbers), 
		json.dumps will raise an error if it encounters non-string keys.
